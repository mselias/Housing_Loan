# Home Loan
This is a git repository for the Kaggle Home Loan Challenge and will be made public. This is a work in progress and updates to this git repository will be made regularly. The current complete procedures are as follows:

1) Data loading onto a MySQL Database from Python
2) Beginning stages of Data Processing

The next steps are as follows:

1) Completion of Data Processing
2) Exploratory Data Analysis of the features
3) Feature Engineering
4) Machine Learning model development and evaluation

Once these steps are completes, results will be evaluated and the process will be repeated again till we obtain optimal results. As we proceed, updates will be made on this read.md file as well as on the associated Jupyter notebooks. Submission of the results at the end of this project. Thank you!
